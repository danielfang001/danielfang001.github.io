In this rollercoaster project, we successfully identified a few correlations between the parameters such as height and speed after cleaning the data by getting ride of the parameters that bear significant loss. The following graph shows the dot plot and the regression that shows the positive correlation. Since it got substantiated by concrete evidence, inference about how the parameters can affect each other can be made. The most important part of the project turns out to the be ranking system. Due to the incompleteness of the official Buzzranking, we are motivated to create our own based on our own understanding about what parameters affect the custom rating of a rollercoaster. As a result, we decided to consider speed, number of inversions, and height in our ranking system and began by creating three separate data frames, each with one of these factors. By sorting each data frame into its own individual ranking, we weighted the ranking of inversions and speed at 40% and height at 20%. Eventually, we added up the partial credits in the different parameter rankings to get the ultimate overall ranking. Creating our own ranking system allow us to carefully consider the factors that decide the rating, which is indeed nontransparent in a ranking provided by some organizations.
