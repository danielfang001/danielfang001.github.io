Title: Final Project Daily Log
---

Below is a log of my daily progress, including:

1.) What I worked on today

2.) What I learned

3.) Any road blocks or questions that I need to get answered

4.) What my goals are for tomorrow

**January 7th**
I basically reviewed materials and other people's work on music generation using LSTM and music21 for MIDI data extraction. I learned about the difference between STM and LSTM, having additional forget and output update function. I still need to explore the actual code for LSTM, and I will work on this particularly with Eric. My Goal for tomorrow is that I'm able to start inputing the data preproccessed.
