Title: Final Project Daily Log
---

Below is a log of my daily progress, including:

1.) What I worked on today

2.) What I learned

3.) Any road blocks or questions that I need to get answered

4.) What my goals are for tomorrow

**January 7th**
I basically reviewed materials and other people's work on music generation using LSTM and music21 for MIDI data extraction. I learned about the difference between STM and LSTM, having additional forget and output update function. I still need to explore the actual code for LSTM, and I will work on this particularly with Eric. My Goal for tomorrow is that I'm able to start inputing the data preproccessed.

**January 8th**
Today, without Eric's presence in class, I learned about the ways to make our code run faster. SInce our last run took 5 hours, we need to find a server GPU that can save us time. I looked mainly at google colab and google cloud platform. I tried google colab and realized that it is very hard to upload the dataset directly from local. I'm going to try to upload our huge data set( >10GB) to github and access through github from colab. I also started reading about the other people's example of using LSTM to read midi files that are converted into matrixes. I still need to work out how the model works because there are a lot of layers. My goals for tomorrow is to build our own model and learn more about the example's model before that.
